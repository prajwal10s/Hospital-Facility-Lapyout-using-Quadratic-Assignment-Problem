# Hospital-Facility-Layout-using-Quadratic-Assignment-Problem
This is a python code for Hospital Facility layout using Quadratic Assignment Peoblem.
This is a part of my DSA project.
The python code calculates shortest distance between 2 facilities.
It uses factral tree data structure.
There is one predefined test case to run. 
Other test cases can be built and tested on the code as well.
